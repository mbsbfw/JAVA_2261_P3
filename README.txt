JAVA Program: Wumpus World

WUMPUS WORLD is a user friendly game which is based around a [4][4]2D array gameboard of objects. The concept of the game is to explore 
around this world trying to find the gold while dodging pits and trying not to run into the monster Wumpus. It gives you hints when
you are close or approaching these pits and Wumpus. The user is allowed to either move north, south, east or weast. This allows them
to move up, down, left or right in this 4 X 4 2d array gameboard.

This game was made to use three different classes Project3(driver), Square, and WumpusWorld. The WumpusWorld class was the only 
class to deal with the Square class. To create the game it consisted of using many for loops and conditional statements. One for 
loop initiated the 2D array with objects of the square class which was set to empty or in my case false. Other for loops placed
the objects where they needed to go in the array and definitely were needed to show the board. The Project3 or driver class initiated
the game by calling WumpusWorld and then like most games ran through a while loop to accomplish playing the game until the game 
was over.

For me it was a bit of chanlleging task to get the game going but with help I think it came out to be quite successful.
